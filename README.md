Group project "Ice cream Shop" implemented after the end of the block HTML and CSS. 
My tasks:
Ð¡reate and style a section "Products".
Having implemented pictures through CSS as a background, used the property "background-image". 
Also, clicking on the button with an "arrow", opens a modal window with additional information about the product and the button "Buy now".
Despite the fact that each participant had their own tasks. We helped each other at any time. The result of our work can be seen on the live page.
The project used: HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript.
Utilites: VsCode, Figma, Git/GitHub, Parcel.
